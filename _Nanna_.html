            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>Since expanding her Songbird phase, Nanna recruited five musicians, that eventually became Of Monsters and Men in 2010 – Brynjar Leifsson, Ragnar Porhallsson, Arnar Rosenkranz Hilmarsson, Arni Guojonsson (now, ex-member), and Kristjan Pall Kristjansson. After a week of working together, they won the annual music competition Musiktilraunir.
                They soon released their debut studio album My Head Is an Animal in late 2011. The album charted in multiple regions and the band gained popularity worldwide. After the Seattle radio station KEXP broadcast a performance from Ragnar's living room, the band went viral. The album reached No.1 in Australia, Iceland and Ireland and No.1 on the U.S. Rock and Alternative charts. The band was tapped to write a song for the film The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and then a single Dirty Paws that was used in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty 18 months after its release. The song "I of the Storm" was included in the USA television series "Falling Water".       
                They released three singles called "Little Talks", "Mountain Sound", and "King and Lionheart" and music videos for each. The videos received several million views on YouTube, the one for "Little Talks" having the most views (295 million views as of November 2020).
                The band went on to release the album Beneath the Skin in 2015, along with three music videos and thirteen lyric videos. Their latest album, Fever Dream, was released in May 2019.
